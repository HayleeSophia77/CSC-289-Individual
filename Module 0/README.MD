# Reflection Prompts

Now that you've established your professional GitHub presence and learned about our AI-assisted learning approach, take a moment to reflect on the journey ahead.

Respond to these questions in a short reflection essay (yes, you can let Flash "polish it up", but don't let it think for you):

1. Your Programming Goals: What do you hope to accomplish by the end of CSC 134? What drew you to programming in the first place?

2. Professional Identity: How did it feel to create your GitHub account and profile? What does having a "professional developer presence" mean to you?

3. AI Partnership: After reading about our approach to using Flash as a learning partner, what are your thoughts on AI-assisted learning? How do you plan to use AI tools to help you learn without doing the work for you?

4. Expectations vs. Reality: What did you expect programming class to be like? How does our approach (GitHub, AI partnership, professional tools) compare to your expectations?

5. Looking Ahead: As you start this "internship" in programming, what are you most excited about? What are you most nervous about?

# Submission Guidelines

* Write in a conversational, personal tone
* Be honest about your feelings and expectations
* No technical knowledge required - this is about you, not code!
* Proofread for basic grammar and spelling

# Purpose

This reflection helps me understand your background and goals so I can better support your learning journey. It also serves as a baseline you can look back on at the end of the semester to see how much you've grown!
